**Machine learning for quantum error correction â€” building a transformer-based decoder for stabiliser codes.**

A compact, research-style project that trains a **Transformer** to decode **syndromes** from the **7-qubit Steane code** (CSS code). The model learns to map 6-bit syndromes to the most likely **single-qubit X/Z error location**, and is compared against classical baselines.
